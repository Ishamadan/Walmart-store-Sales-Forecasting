The data is picked up from -https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data
# Walmart-store-Sales-Forecasting
Content - The Data is provided with historical sales of 45 stores of a company and each store is having ~99 departments. The task is to predict sales of each store department for future.
Approach - 
Split the data (70% tarining, 30% testing)
1. Exploratory data analysis (find relations, explore null values if any, visualize data)
2. Feature Engineering - ( fill missing values, Convert Date feature to discreate feature, drop non correlated features
3. Apply random forest regressor
4. Score- mse

Feedback - training score is too high, there are high chances of overfitting model)
Let me know how can I improve this.
